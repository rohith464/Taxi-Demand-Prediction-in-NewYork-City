# Taxi-Demand-Prediction-in-NewYork-City
- This is my First case study which is a time series prediction problem
- In NewYork City yellow taxi is the major taxi. Here we predict how many people will be present at a particular region in a 10 min interval.
- Many algorithms are implemented and plotted the results in a pretty table. All the detaila are clearly mentioned in the ipython notebbok.
- This can be helpful for the drivers to know where the demand will be in next 10 min.
